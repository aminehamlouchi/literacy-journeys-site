            <h1>Pathways to Literacy: A Multimodal Exploration of Our Literacy Journeys</h1>
            <p>Welcome! This website showcases the literacy journeys of our group members: Amine, Logan, Sydney, and Elum. Here we explore how family, schooling, and personal experiences shaped our approaches to literacy.</p>

            <h2>Amine's Literacy Journey</h2>
            <p>Amine's journey into literacy was deeply intertwined with his religious upbringing. From a young age, he was surrounded by Islamic teachings, which served as his initial literacy sponsors. The influence of scholars like Ibn Taymiyyah guided his growth and developed his critical thinking in religious contexts.</p>

            <h2>Logan's Literacy Journey</h2>
            <p>Logan's journey began with Dr. Seuss books, read to him by his family. His early love for storytelling was also supported by a local librarian who introduced him to a wide range of books. Logan eventually moved from creative writing to academic writing, learning to balance structure with creativity.</p>

        <section id="sydney" class="member-page">
            <h2>Sydney's Literacy Journey</h2>
            <p>Sydney's literacy foundation was shaped by her grandmother and mother, both educators. Early experiences with classic literature made reading a family affair. Despite encountering a discouraging teacher in high school, she was able to rediscover her love for reading through personal exploration and family support.</p>

            <h2>Elum's Literacy Journey</h2>
            <p>Elum's literacy path was unique due to his ADD/ADHD. Despite facing challenges with focus, his family supported him, and he found personalized strategies to succeed. By emphasizing his strengths in picking out key details, Elum adapted to make literacy work for him.</p>
